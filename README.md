# Current status of this project

Currently taking a break from this to do easier projects as I was getting frustrated.

## Overview

I am creating this project to work on my HTML & CSS skills, and develop further. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Make my recreation of this page appear as similar as possible to this:

## My process

### Built with

-HTML
-CSS
-flexbox
-my fingers
-the patience of my loved ones who put up with me spending huge portions of my time studying/practicing/learning/sweating to hopefully one day become a developer
-My tears

### What I hope to learn and what I have learned

What I hope to learn? I want to learn how to make the purple thing go up a bit, and make the mobile phone stick over the top of the purple and white page bits, and also how to chop off the white bits surrounding the mobile phone image (I have some research to do).

What I have learned? **write that in here when you've completed this project**

That I know eff all. Responsiveness? Responsiveness? Whaaaat is this shit?!

Anyways, I am taking a break from this project and will work on an easier one, and come back to this hopefully in next few weeks. I could keep going with this right now but I feel like my time would be better focused on improving my understanding on flexbox and how to make a page responsive through challenges that aren't quite so challenging, and come back to this when I have a little bit more experience under my belt.

### Continued development

Write in here when you are done, with things that you want to improve on/ need to get better at/ need to do further research on so that you are sure you have your head wrapped around it all.
